# pkg directory

The `pkg` directory is where most of the code reside. For a nirvana server, you should expect an `apis` sub directory where you can find the API definitions and Nirvana descriptors. 

```
|-- pkg
|   |-- apis
|   |   |-- v1alpha1
|   |   |   |-- (v1alpha1 APIs related code)
|   |-- (more packages)
```
